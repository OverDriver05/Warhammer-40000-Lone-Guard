All of whom whose motivations contradicts with the will of the almighty God-Emperor and each other, though the ends is always the same: All of them must die in the name of the Emperor of Mankind, either by the hands of their Adeptus Astartes and their mighty legion, or by the enormous forces of the Astra Militarium.*

*Yet, there exist a long-forgotten legend amongst the vast tales of heroism done by the many soldiers and Space Marines, one whose very existence were always shrouded in mystery and often shrubbed off from all known records of the Inquisition, and one whose exploits are remembered by those fortunate enough to be the same battlefield as them.*

*The legend of the Lone Guard.*

*Nobody knows who or what is the Lone Guard, nor does their true allegiance, though those who witnessed their battles seems to confirm to be on the side of the Imperium. Yet, they chose not to be associate to them, nor to any of its factions for that matter, all so they can continue fighting back against the Heretic, the Mutant and the Alien. Alone, outnumbered and with impossible odds.*
